Predicting Road Crash Severity - Data Science Project
Welcome to the Predicting Road Crash Severity data science project repository! This project aims to develop a machine learning predictive model to classify road crash severity in the state of Victoria, Australia. By leveraging advanced statistical techniques, machine learning algorithms, and comprehensive data analysis, we seek to gain valuable insights into the factors that contribute to road accidents and their severity, ultimately aiding in the enhancement of road safety measures.

Overview
Road accidents pose a significant societal issue with global implications. In Victoria, Australia, an average of 240 people lose their lives annually in such incidents (Transport Accident Commission, 2021). Analyzing accident severity and identifying contributing factors has become increasingly critical. To address this challenge, we have gathered a comprehensive dataset of 60,680 instances and 49 variables, encompassing various pre-accident and post-accident factors.

Data Exploration
We will begin by performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. The dataset comprises two main groups of variables: pre-accident variables, which are known prior to the accident, and post-accident variables, which can only be determined once the accident has occurred. Our EDA will delve into feature distributions, correlations, and class proportions, enabling us to gain essential insights before developing the predictive model.

Machine Learning Model
Building upon the insights from our EDA, we will develop a multivariate time series imbalanced classification model. The multiclass classification task involves four classes of severity levels, each with varying proportions. We will explore various machine learning algorithms, perform feature engineering, and experiment with different strategies to handle the class imbalance.

Evaluation and Results
Our model will be evaluated using appropriate metrics for imbalanced datasets, such as precision-recall curves and F1-score. We will conduct cross-validation to assess the model's performance and fine-tune hyperparameters to achieve optimal results. The project aims to produce a robust predictive model that accurately classifies road crash severity in real-world scenarios.
